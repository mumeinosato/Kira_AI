## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

**"No module named..."** → Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

**"File not found" for model** → Make sure your model file is in the `models/` folder and the name matches your `.env` file

**Kira can't hear you** → Check your microphone permissions and make sure it's not muted

**No Twitch chat** → Verify your Twitch OAuth token and channel name in `.env`

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

✅ **Your data stays private** - All conversations and settings stay on your computer  
✅ **No data is shared** - Kira doesn't send your conversations anywhere  
✅ **API keys are secure** - Keep your `.env` file private, never share it online
